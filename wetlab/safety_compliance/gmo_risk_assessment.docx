# Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Risk Assessment

## Project Information
**Project Title**: Expression of Redox-Balancing Enzymes for Metabolic Engineering
**Principal Investigator**: Dr. Omar Farooq
**Date**: July 14, 2025
**Biosafety Level**: BSL-1

## GMO Description

### Host Organisms
1. **E. coli BL21(DE3)** - Risk Group 1, non-pathogenic laboratory strain
2. **S. cerevisiae BY4741** - Risk Group 1, standard laboratory yeast
3. **HEK293T** - Risk Group 1, immortalized human cell line

### Genetic Modifications
- Expression of NADH oxidases from E. coli and L. brevis
- Expression of malate dehydrogenase isoforms (MDH1/MDH2)
- Expression of aspartate aminotransferase variants
- All enzymes are from Risk Group 1 organisms
- No pathogenicity factors or toxin genes

### Vectors
- pET28a (kanamycin resistance)
- pYES2 (ampicillin resistance, URA3 selection)
- Standard commercial vectors with no mobilization genes

## Risk Assessment

### Hazard Identification
| Hazard | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Antibiotic resistance spread | Low | No conjugative elements; standard lab strains |
| Environmental release | Very Low | Contained use only; autoclave waste |
| Human exposure | Very Low | Non-pathogenic hosts; standard PPE |
| Allergenicity | Very Low | No known allergens; His-tag only modification |

### Environmental Impact
- Organisms unable to survive outside laboratory conditions
- No competitive advantage in natural environments
- Metabolic burden reduces fitness
- Standard disinfection effective

### Human Health Impact
- No production of toxins or virulence factors
- Enzymes involved in normal cellular metabolism
- No oncogenic potential
- Standard laboratory safety sufficient

## Containment Measures

### Physical Containment
- Work conducted in BSL-1 laboratory
- Biological safety cabinet for aerosol-generating procedures
- Closed centrifuge tubes
- No work on open bench with live cultures

### Biological Containment
- Disabled strains requiring specific nutrients
- Antibiotic resistance markers for containment
- No self-transmissible elements
- Regular contamination monitoring

### Waste Management
- All biological waste autoclaved at 121Â°C for 30 min
- Liquid waste treated with 10% bleach before disposal
- Contaminated plasticware in biohazard bags
- Sharps in appropriate containers

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Personal Protective Equipment
- Lab coat (buttoned, full-length)
- Gloves (nitrile, changed regularly)
- Safety glasses when appropriate
- Closed-toe shoes required

### Work Practices
- No eating, drinking, or cosmetics in lab
- Wash hands after work and before leaving
- Minimize aerosol generation
- Report all spills immediately

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Spill Response**:
   - Alert others in area
   - Cover with absorbent material
   - Apply 10% bleach solution
   - Wait 20 minutes before cleanup

2. **Exposure Response**:
   - Skin: Wash with soap and water
   - Eyes: Flush 15 minutes at eyewash
   - Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting, seek medical attention
   - Report to PI and biosafety officer

## Training Requirements
- General biosafety training completed
- GMO-specific training documented
- Annual refresher required
- New personnel supervised until competent

## Regulatory Compliance
- Complies with NIH Guidelines for Recombinant DNA
- Registered with Institutional Biosafety Committee
- No human gene therapy or germline modification
- No deliberate environmental release

## Declaration
I certify that this risk assessment accurately describes the proposed work and that all personnel will comply with the containment and safety measures described.
