# Wet Lab Implementation Guide for Redox-Balancing Enzyme Constructs

## Project Overview
This directory contains all necessary documentation for transitioning AI-designed redox-balancing enzyme constructs from computational predictions to experimental validation.

**Goal**: Express and validate NADH oxidase and malate-aspartate shuttle enzyme constructs that improve cellular NAD+/NADH ratios by 15-25% while maintaining >95% growth viability.

## Quick Start
1. Review `construct_manifest.xlsx` for enzyme selection
2. Order primers from `cloning/primer_list.csv`
3. Follow `cloning/GoldenGate_protocol.md` for construct assembly
4. Use protocols in `expression/` for protein production
5. Validate with assays in `assays/` directory

## Expected Outcomes
- 4-6 week timeline from construct ordering to validation data
- Functional expression of 3-4 lead enzyme constructs
- Quantitative NAD+/NADH ratio improvements matching computational predictions
