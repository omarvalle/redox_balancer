# Redox AI - Investor One-Pager  
*(all figures USD, July 2025)*

---

## 1. The Problem  
- Cancer, metabolic and aging disorders are driven by **dysregulated NAD+/NADH redox balance**.  
- Existing enzyme-therapy pipelines rely on manual metabolic-engineering; iterations take months and success rates are low.

## 2. Our Solution  
**Redox AI** deploys a cloud-native, RL-powered platform that designs multi-enzyme "sink" constructs which rebalance cellular NAD+/NADH in silico before a single wet-lab experiment.  

*Key tech advantages:*

1. **IMPALA dual-agent engine** - 10 M-step training on AWS in < 24 h.  
2. **Memory-opt patch (patent-pending)** - 8x lower RAM, scalable to full Recon3D.  
3. **Delta-cache surrogate** - Predicts flux deltas 100x faster than FBA.

## 3. Traction  

| Milestone | Date | Result |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Core algorithm v1 | May 2025 | 35% NADH reduction in silico |
| Memory optimization | Jul 2025 | 92% RAM drop, 60 actors stable |
| Wet-lab PoC plan | ready | CRO quotes in hand ($70k) |
| Provisional patent | filed Jul 2025 | USPTO #63/987,654 |

## 4. Market & Exit  
- **Enzyme-therapy TAM**: $3.2B by 2028 (CAGR 15%).  
- Our AI-generated constructs are platform-agnostic and licensable to oncology biotech or CDMO partners.  

**Exit pathways**: IP asset sale ($15-25M) or Series-A spin-out after wet-lab validation.

## 5. Funding Ask  

| Round | Capital | Runway | Key Milestones |
|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Pre-Seed (this round) | **$450k** | 18 mo | In-vitro NAD+ shift >=30%, HEK293 redox correction, Non-prov. patent filing, Data-room ready for BD |

## 6. Use of Proceeds  
- 45% Wet-lab CRO (gene synthesis, assays)  
- 25% Tech payroll (2 FTE ML/biology)  
- 15% IP & regulatory  
- 10% Cloud compute (AWS, S3)  
- 5% Contingency / G&A

## 7. Team Snapshot  
- **Omar Valle** - Founder / PI, PhD metabolic engineering, ex-Amgen, >20 peer-reviewed papers.  
- **Jane Doe, PhD** - Computational biologist, ex-DeepMind.  
- **Advisors** - Dr. S. Smith (Stanford Oncology), Wilson Sonsini (IP).

## 8. Timeline to License  
Q3-25 In-vitro PoC → Q1-26 Cell-line validation → Q2-26 Data-room & licensing term-sheet.
