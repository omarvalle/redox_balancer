## Field
Computational biotechnology; metabolic engineering; reinforcement learning; cloud computing for biological systems.

## One-Sentence Summary
A cloud-based IMPALA reinforcement learning pipeline autonomously designs enzyme constructs that optimize NAD+/NADH flux in genome-scale metabolic models, achieving stable training on 10,000+ reaction networks while reducing memory usage by 95% through novel caching and garbage collection techniques.

## Problem Addressed

### Technical Challenges
- **Memory Explosion**: Traditional reinforcement learning on genome-scale metabolic models (10,000+ reactions) suffers from severe memory leaks, with actor processes growing from 3GB to 18GB during training, causing system crashes every 2 hours.
- **Computational Complexity**: Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) optimization requires repeated solution of large linear programming problems, creating computational bottlenecks for RL training.
- **Action Space Design**: Enzyme selection involves combinatorial choices across reaction types, cellular compartments, and expression levels, requiring structured exploration strategies.

### Biological Problem
- **Redox Imbalance**: Cancer cells and engineered microorganisms suffer from NAD+/NADH ratio imbalances, leading to reduced metabolic efficiency and growth.
- **Manual Design Limitations**: Traditional metabolic engineering relies on expert knowledge and trial-and-error, taking weeks to months for enzyme selection and often yielding suboptimal results.
- **Dynamic Cofactor Balance**: Static flux balance analysis ignores temporal dynamics of cofactor regeneration, missing opportunities for systematic redox optimization.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Memory-Optimized IMPALA Architecture
- **Model Reuse**: Eliminates expensive Model.copy() operations by maintaining a single working model instance per actor, reducing memory from 45GB to <1GB.
- **Solution Minification**: Converts large pandas DataFrames in COBRApy Solution objects to minimal numpy arrays, preventing unbounded accumulation.
- **FBA Cache Management**: Implements size-limited caching (5,000 entries) with FIFO eviction to prevent memory growth during long training runs.
- **Forced Garbage Collection**: Strategic gc.collect() calls at episode boundaries to ensure memory cleanup.

### 2. Dual-Agent Self-Play Framework
- **Tumor Agent**: Learns to maximize NADH consumption and metabolic efficiency under growth constraints.
- **Sink Designer Agent**: Learns to design enzyme constructs that improve redox balance while maintaining cellular viability.
- **Competitive Training**: Agents learn through adversarial optimization, with the tumor agent challenging the sink designer to create robust solutions.

### 3. Cloud-Native Training Infrastructure
- **Distributed Computing**: Utilizes Ray framework with 60 parallel actors on AWS r7i.48xlarge instances (1.5TB RAM, 192 vCPUs).
- **Automatic Checkpointing**: Saves model states every 30 seconds with automatic S3 upload for fault tolerance.
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory profiling with automatic restart if actor memory exceeds thresholds.

### 4. Structured Action Space
- **Enzyme Library**: Curated database of NADH oxidases, malate-aspartate shuttle components, and redox-active transporters.
- **Compartment Selection**: Explicit modeling of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and peroxisomal enzyme targeting.
- **Expression Level Optimization**: Continuous control over enzyme copy numbers and activity levels.
