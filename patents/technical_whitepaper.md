# Technical Specification for Provisional Patent Application

## Invention Title: Memory-Optimized Reinforcement Learning for Metabolic Engineering and Redox Balance Optimization

## Abstract

This invention describes a novel computer-implemented method for optimizing cellular redox balance through reinforcement learning-guided enzyme design. The method addresses critical memory management challenges that previously prevented RL training on genome-scale metabolic models, achieving 95% memory reduction while maintaining computational performance. The system successfully designed enzyme constructs that improve NAD+/NADH ratios in human metabolic networks through a distributed IMPALA architecture deployed on cloud infrastructure.

## 1. Background and Technical Problem

### 1.1 Metabolic Engineering Challenges

Cellular metabolism depends critically on maintaining appropriate cofactor balances, particularly the NAD+/NADH ratio which affects hundreds of enzymatic reactions. Traditional metabolic engineering approaches rely on manual selection of enzyme modifications, requiring extensive domain expertise and often yielding suboptimal results.

Computational approaches using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) can predict metabolic behavior but suffer from several limitations:
- Static optimization ignores dynamic cofactor regeneration
- Combinatorial explosion of possible enzyme modifications
- Difficulty in optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously

### 1.2 Reinforcement Learning for Metabolic Design

Recent work has applied reinforcement learning to metabolic engineering, but existing methods face severe scalability limitations:

**Memory Explosion Problem**: When applying RL to genome-scale metabolic models (>10,000 reactions), actor processes experience severe memory leaks:
- Initial memory: 3-4 GB per actor
- Memory growth: Linear increase to 10-18 GB over 2 hours
- System failure: Out-of-memory crashes requiring restart
- Training interruption: Cannot complete long training runs

**Root Causes of Memory Leaks**:
1. **Model Copying**: COBRApy Model.copy() operations allocate new memory for large constraint matrices
2. **Solution Accumulation**: FBA solutions contain large pandas DataFrames that accumulate in memory
3. **Cache Growth**: Unbounded caching of FBA results leads to memory exhaustion
4. **Garbage Collection Failure**: Python's garbage collector fails to clean up circular references

### 1.3 Technical Objectives

This invention addresses the memory scalability problem while maintaining:
- High-throughput RL training (>500 FPS)
- Stable memory usage over extended training periods
- Fault-tolerant cloud deployment
- Biological relevance of learned enzyme designs

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overall System Design

The system implements a distributed IMPALA (Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) with the following components (see FIG-1):

```
[Cloud Infrastructure Layer]
├── AWS r7i.48xlarge (1.5TB RAM, 192 vCPUs)
├── Ray Distributed Computing Framework
└── S3 Storage for Checkpoints and Results

[Training Layer]
├── Learner Process (Neural Network Updates)
├── 60 Parallel Actor Processes (Experience Generation)
└── Memory Monitoring and Management

[Environment Layer]
├── Metabolic Model Integration (COBRApy)
├── FBA Solver Interface (GLPK)
└── Action Space Management (Enzyme Library)

[Memory Optimization Layer]
├── Model Reuse System
├── Solution Minification
├── Cache Management
└── Garbage Collection
```

FIG-1 illustrates the complete system architecture, showing the distributed Ray actors running on AWS EC2, with memray memory profiling and S3 storage integration.

### 2.2 Dual-Agent Framework

The system employs two competing agents:

**Tumor Agent**:
- Objective: Maximize metabolic efficiency under redox stress
- Action space: Flux adjustments within physiological constraints
- Reward: Based on growth rate and NADH consumption

**Sink Designer Agent**:
- Objective: Design enzyme constructs to improve redox balance
- Action space: Enzyme selection, compartment targeting, expression levels
- Reward: Based on successful redox optimization and minimal metabolic burden

### 2.3 Neural Network Architecture

Both agents use identical network architectures:
- Input: Metabolic state vector (flux values, metabolite concentrations)
- Hidden layers: 3 fully connected layers (512, 256, 128 neurons)
- Output: Action probabilities and value estimates
- Activation: ReLU for hidden layers, softmax for action probabilities

## 3. Memory Optimization Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Analysis

Memory profiling using memray identified three primary sources of memory leaks:

```
Memory Allocation Analysis (before optimization):
├── Model.copy() operations: 45GB (32.3%)
├── GLPK solver allocations: 32GB (23.1%)
├── COBRApy Solution objects: 19GB (13.5%)
└── Other allocations: 44GB (31.1%)
Total: 140GB per 2-hour training session
```

### 3.2 Solution 1: Model Reuse System

**Problem**: Each environment reset called `model.copy()`, creating new constraint matrices.

**Solution**: Implement scratch model reuse:

```python
class MemoryOptimizedEnv:
    def reset(self):
        # MEMORY FIX: Reuse model instead of copying
        if not hasattr(self, "_working_model"):
            self._working_model = self.base_model.copy()
        self.model = self._working_model
        
        # Reset model state without copying
        self._reset_model_state()
```

**Impact**: Reduced model-related memory from 45GB to <1GB.

### 3.3 Solution 2: FBA Cache Management

**Problem**: Unbounded FBA result caching led to memory exhaustion.

**Solution**: Implement size-limited FIFO cache:

```python
def solve_fba_with_cache(self, cache_key):
    # MEMORY FIX: Limit cache size
    if len(self.fba_cache) > 5000:
        # Remove oldest 1000 entries
        keys_to_remove = list(self.fba_cache.keys())[:1000]
        for k in keys_to_remove:
            del self.fba_cache[k]
    
    if cache_key in self.fba_cache:
        return self.fba_cache[cache_key]
    
    solution = self.model.optimize()
    if solution.status == "optimal":
        self.fba_cache[cache_key] = solution
    
    return solution
```

**Impact**: Prevented unbounded cache growth while maintaining 80%+ cache hit rates.

### 3.3 Solution 3: Solution Object Minification

**Problem**: COBRApy Solution objects contain large pandas DataFrames.

**Solution**: Convert to minimal data structures:

```python
class MinifiedSolution:
    def __init__(self, solution):
        self.status = solution.status
        self.objective_value = solution.objective_value
        # Store only essential fluxes as numpy arrays
        self.fluxes_dict = {
            "biomass": solution.fluxes.get("biomass_reaction", 0.0),
            "oxygen": solution.fluxes.get("EX_o2_e", 0.0),
            "glucose": solution.fluxes.get("EX_glc__D_e", 0.0)
        }
```

**Impact**: Reduced solution storage from DataFrames (>1MB each) to dictionaries (<1KB each).

### 3.4 Solution 4: Forced Garbage Collection

**Problem**: Python's garbage collector failed to clean up circular references.

**Solution**: Strategic garbage collection:

```python
def reset(self):
    # ... environment reset logic ...
    
    # MEMORY FIX: Clear caches and force garbage collection
    if hasattr(self, "fba_cache"):
        self.fba_cache.clear()
    if hasattr(self, "_solution_cache"):
        self._solution_cache.clear()
    gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
```

**Impact**: Ensured memory cleanup at episode boundaries.

### 3.5 Combined Memory Optimization Results

```
Memory Usage Comparison:
                    Before      After       Improvement
Actor Average:      10.5 GB     1.08 GB     89.7%
Actor Maximum:      18.0 GB     1.17 GB     93.5%
Total System:       1,413 GB    46 GB       96.7%
Training Duration:  2 hours     6+ hours    3x improvement
Crash Frequency:    Every 2hrs  None        100% reduction
```

FIG-3 visually demonstrates the dramatic memory reduction achieved, showing per-actor RSS memory usage dropping from 14 GB to 1.08 GB (92.3% reduction).

### 4.2 Reward Function

The reward function balances multiple objectives:

```python
def calculate_reward(self, solution, action):
    # Primary objective: NADH sink flux
    sink_flux = sum(solution.fluxes[rxn_id] 
                   for rxn_id in solution.fluxes.index 
                   if rxn_id.startswith("SINK_"))
    r_metabolite = self.redox_weight * sink_flux
    
    # Growth constraint penalty
    growth_rate = solution.fluxes["biomass_reaction"]
    growth_penalty = 0.0
    if growth_rate < 0.95 * self.baseline_growth:
        growth_penalty = self.biomass_penalty_weight * (
            0.95 * self.baseline_growth - growth_rate
        )
    
    # HIF pathway penalty (cancer-specific)
    hif_penalty = self.hif_penalty_weight * max(0, 
        solution.fluxes.get("HIF1A_stabilization", 0))
    
    return r_metabolite - growth_penalty - hif_penalty
```
