This folder contains **all materials needed to e-file a U.S. provisional patent application**.

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| invention_overview.md | Plain-English + tech summary (good "Description" section seed) |
| technical_whitepaper.md | Detailed support under 35 U.S.C. §112 (enablement, best-mode). |
| claims_draft.md | Initial claim set to preserve broadest scope. |
| figures/* | Numbered drawings; referenced in the white-paper and claims. |
| prior_art_table.md | Comparative table for future non-provisional drafting. |
| experiment_results.xlsx | Empirical data proving utility/significance. |
| disclosure_form.txt | Inventorship + funding; keeps you Bayh-Dole compliant. |
| cover_letter.txt | Template transmittal for USPTO EFS-Web upload. |

**Filing steps**

1. Zip the `patents/` folder.  
2. Go to https://efs.uspto.gov and choose "Provisional".  
3. Upload:  
   • Specification → `technical_whitepaper.md` (convert to PDF first)  
   • Drawings → every file in `figures/` (PDF or PNG)  
   • Cover sheet → auto-generated by EFS (fill; you may attach `disclosure_form.txt`).  
4. Pay $80 (micro entity) or $150 (small entity).  
5. Get the confirmation receipt – done!

> Important: Provisional requires *no* formal claims, but we include `claims_draft.md`
> so you have a 12-month head-start on the non-provisional.
